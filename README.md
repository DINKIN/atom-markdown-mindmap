# Markdown Mindmap

Type `mind` in the Atom command palette to open a mindmap view of the current markdown file. The full command name is `Markdown Mindmap: Toggle`.

By default there is no keyboard shortcut to avoid conflicts. If you want to use one open menu `Edit -> Keymap...` and add this to the file:

```
'atom-workspace':
  'ctrl-alt-m': 'markdown-mindmap:toggle'
```

You can switch between different themes in package settings. Dark themes variants are also available.

This extension is built using the [markmap](https://github.com/dundalek/markmap) component.

## Publishing

Notes to myself:
- Do not use `npm version` before publishing, just use `apm publish major|minor|patch` which takes care of everything.
- If the command asks for username and password then [personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/) can be used in place of the password.
